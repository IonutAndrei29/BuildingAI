Simple AI Project
Final project for the Building AI course
Summary
This project is a basic AI-powered chatbot that can answer common questions and provide simple recommendations. It is designed for beginners to understand the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP).
Background
Many people want to explore AI but find it overwhelming. This project provides a simple and interactive way to:
•	Learn how chatbots work
•	Experiment with basic NLP techniques
•	Understand AI model training and deployment
How is it used?
Users interact with the chatbot through a command-line interface or a simple web app. It can answer basic questions like "What is AI?" and suggest resources for learning more. It is useful for students, educators, and AI enthusiasts.
Example interaction:
User: What is AI?
Bot: AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It refers to machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence.
Data sources and AI methods
The chatbot uses:
•	A pre-trained NLP model for understanding user queries
•	A small dataset of FAQs to provide responses
•	Open-source libraries like NLTK or spaCy
Challenges
•	The chatbot has limited knowledge and may not answer complex questions
•	Ethical considerations around AI-generated responses
•	Potential biases in training data
What next?
•	Improve accuracy with larger datasets
•	Add voice interaction
•	Expand the chatbot’s knowledge base
Acknowledgments
•	Inspired by open-source chatbot projects
•	Uses publicly available NLP tools and datasets
